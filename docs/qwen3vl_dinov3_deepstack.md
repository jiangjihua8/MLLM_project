# Qwen3-VL + DINOv2/DINOv3 + DeepStack Notes

This document records the current behavior of branch `qwen3vl_deepstack_checkpointing`.

## Scope

The branch is for BEV road centerline reconstruction with:

- Qwen2.5 or Qwen3-VL as the language model.
- DINOv2 or DINOv3 as the vision tower.
- Optional DeepStack visual injection.
- Full-parameter or LoRA training.
- Checkpoint-driven inference that avoids manual DeepStack flags.

## Model Data Flow

Main visual path:

```text
image
  -> DINOv2/DINOv3 ViT
  -> selected main ViT layer
  -> mm_projector
  -> replace <image> token positions in LLM embeddings
  -> LLM decoder
```

DeepStack path:

```text
selected intermediate ViT layers
  -> independent DeepStack merger MLPs
  -> token-aligned visual residuals
  -> injected into early LLM decoder layers at image-token positions
```

The main visual embedding remains the normal image-token embedding. DeepStack adds extra visual residuals inside decoder layers; it does not append extra text tokens.

For the default DINOv3-L setup:

```text
DINOv3 layer 23 -> main visual feature -> mm_projector -> image-token embeddings
DINOv3 layers 6, 12, 18, 23 -> DeepStack mergers -> LLM early-layer residual injection
```

Each DeepStack merger is independent:

```text
LayerNorm(vit_dim) -> Linear(vit_dim, llm_dim) -> GELU -> Linear(llm_dim, llm_dim)
```

## DeepStack And Gradient Checkpointing

DeepStack injection is implemented through the decoder forward path, not through fragile forward hooks.

The intended combination is:

```text
DeepStack enabled
gradient_checkpointing True
DeepSpeed ZeRO3 supported
```

This avoids the previous failure modes:

- different tensor counts between checkpoint forward and recomputation
- backward-through-graph-a-second-time errors
- hook order issues under recomputation

## DINO Detection

The code prefers explicit metadata when available and otherwise infers the vision tower from the path.

Common paths:

```text
dinov2                  -> DINOv2
dinov3-vitl16           -> DINOv3 ViT-L
dinov3-vitb16           -> DINOv3 ViT-B
```

Default image sizes:

```text
DINOv2-L      518
DINOv3-L      224
DINOv3-B      224
```

Most scripts do not pass a strict `--dino_variant`. This is intentional. Training and inference should derive the DINO type from checkpoint metadata or `vision_tower` path unless an experiment explicitly needs an override.

## Training Modes

Full-parameter NPU scripts:

```bash
bash scripts/train_full_dinov2_qwen3vl-8b_deepstack_npu.sh
bash scripts/train_full_dinov2_qwen3vl-8b_no-deepstack_npu.sh
bash scripts/train_full_dinov3_qwen3vl-8b_deepstack_npu.sh
bash scripts/train_full_dinov3_qwen3vl-8b_no-deepstack_npu.sh
```

Non-full training scripts are under:

```text
scripts/npu/
scripts/gpu/
```

Filename meaning:

```text
full             train LLM, ViT, projector, and DeepStack modules
deepstack        enable DeepStack
no-deepstack     disable DeepStack
freeze-vit       freeze ViT, train LLM plus alignment modules
freeze-llm       freeze LLM, train ViT plus alignment modules
dinov2/dinov3    selected vision tower family
```

## Inference Behavior

Inference does not need the user to manually say whether a checkpoint used DeepStack.

The loader checks checkpoint metadata and config files, including:

```text
qwen_multimodal_checkpoint.json
config.json
adapter_config.json
non_lora_trainables.bin
model.safetensors / pytorch_model.bin
```

Behavior:

- DeepStack checkpoint -> inference enables DeepStack automatically.
- No-DeepStack checkpoint -> inference disables DeepStack automatically.
- LoRA checkpoint -> loads adapter weights plus `non_lora_trainables.bin`.
- Full checkpoint -> loads full tensors directly.

`llava_checkpoint.json` is treated as legacy metadata only. Qwen checkpoints should use the Qwen multimodal loading path.

## Test Scripts

NPU full-checkpoint test scripts:

```bash
bash scripts/test_full_dinov2_qwen3vl-8b_npu.sh
bash scripts/test_full_dinov3_qwen3vl-8b_npu.sh
```

They only distinguish DINOv2 vs DINOv3. They do not distinguish DeepStack vs no-DeepStack, because that is recovered from checkpoint metadata.

## Logging

Normal stdout is rank-0 only by default:

```bash
LLAVA_LOG_RANK0_ONLY=1
```

The console uses the Hugging Face Trainer default progress and metric output. It is intentionally kept close to the upstream Trainer behavior because it is easier to read during long runs.

`DI_throughput` is not injected into the console output. It is written to `train_metrics.log`.

Example `train_metrics.log` step line:

```text
time: 2026-05-13 15:43:14  global_step: 1  epoch: 1  loss: 1.23  learning_rate: 2e-05  DI_throughput: 12716.48 tokens/s/npu
```

Checkpoint events and final runtime summaries are also written to files:

```text
train_metrics.log
eval_metrics.log
checkpoint_events.log
```

`train_metrics.log` contains both step metrics and final runtime summaries. `checkpoint_events.log` contains `train_begin`, `save`, and `train_end` events.

## UNEXPECTED Load Warnings

There are two different cases.

Expected case:

```text
qwen2.5 base checkpoint: checkpoints/llava-fastvithd_1.5b_stage2
runtime vision tower: DINOv2 or DINOv3
```

This old base checkpoint contains FastViT / old projector tensors. When switching the runtime vision tower to DINO, those old visual keys can appear as `UNEXPECTED`. This does not mean the DINO checkpoint failed to load.

Problem case:

```text
Qwen3-VL + DINOv3 trained checkpoint
inference reports many DINO vision_tower tensors as UNEXPECTED
or does not report compatible tensor loading
```

That would indicate the wrong loading route or metadata. The current Qwen3-VL + DINOv3 path was checked and reports:

```text
Loaded 754/754 model tensors from full-finetune checkpoint
```

No DINO vision-weight `UNEXPECTED` warning appeared in that path.

## Validation

The latest lightweight two-GPU matrix passed:

```text

DEBUG_CHECK prompt_image_token_ok
```

## Operational Notes

- Use `scripts/deepspeed_zero3.json` when training needs ZeRO3 and gathered weights during save.
- Keep `gradient_checkpointing True` enabled by default.
- Use no-DeepStack scripts only for ablation or when intentionally training a base ViT-projector-LLM model.
- For NPU jobs, prefer enough cards/nodes so ZeRO3 save can gather weights without memory pressure.
- If a run fails before the first training step, `train_metrics.log` is still created at `train_begin`.
